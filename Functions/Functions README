Functions README

This directory contains all the functions that I have written that exist within the other scripts in this repository. If there is an issue due to missing functions please let me know. 

As mentioned in the main readme there are a number of other functions required from the Gibbs Seawater Tool box (GSW, https://www.teos-10.org/software.htm) which you will be required to download. The version used for this project was 3.0 (current version 3.06)
