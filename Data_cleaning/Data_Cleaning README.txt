Data_Cleaning README

To make best use of the scripts in this directory please run the scripts in blocks of ii and iii that can be found in 2021_Flow_Chart_Method.pdf. The files below are ordered in such a way to make this easier but may not be ordered in the same way in the directory itself.

Part ii
Converting_pressure_depth.m : This is a simple script that turns the pressure from the raw data into depth. As Thorpe scaling is calculated over a distance we need to have the depth of the instrument and not the pressure.
